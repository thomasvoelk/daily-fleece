You have encountered the Spring Boot diagnostic error code: `$ARGUMENTS[0]`.
The problem is located in the file: `$ARGUMENTS[1]`.
The text range of the problem is: `$ARGUMENTS[2]` (if provided).

MUST DO: If the error code includes a prefix like `errorCode=` or `code=`, strip it out before you continue to use it anywhere.

To find the official explanation and potential fixes for this issue, you must read the explanation file located at:
`.claude/skills/spring-quickfix/explanations/$ARGUMENTS[0].md` (relative to the repo root)

If the file does not exist, use your general Spring Boot knowledge to fix the issue.

Based on the provided "Explanations" and "Fixes" in that file:
1. Analyze the context of the user's project and the specific file (`$ARGUMENTS[1]`) to determine which of the suggested fixes is the most appropriate.
2. If there are multiple potential fixes and it is unclear which one to apply based on the project context, stop and ask the user which solution they prefer.
3. Once a solution is chosen (either by your analysis or the user's choice), apply the fix to the codebase, specifically targeting the file `$ARGUMENTS[1]`.
4. If a text range (`$ARGUMENTS[2]`) is provided, ensure your fix is applied only around that specific text range.
