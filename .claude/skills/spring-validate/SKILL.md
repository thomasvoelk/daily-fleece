CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Whenever a user asks for problems or validations or diagnsotics or problem markers in the project, or an agent is attempting to check if there are problems with the project, or attempts to validate changes to the project, IF the project is a Spring Boot project, then the `spring-tools-mcp` MCP server MUST be used to check for validation problems in each source file of the project.

To perform this validation:

1. Use the `getProjectDiagnostics` tool from the spring-tools-mcp MCP server to get a list of diagnostics for a specific project. You need to pass in the name of the project. If you are not sure about the exact name, you can invoke `getProjectList` from the spring-tools-mcp MCP server to get the exact names of the projects in the current workspace.
2. Carefully review the returned diagnostics.
3. Identify the specific error code, file path, and text range for each Spring-related diagnostic (e.g. error code "WEB_SECURITY_CONFIGURER_ADAPTER").
4. For every Spring-specific error code you encounter, you MUST invoke the `/spring-quickfix` skill, passing the error code, the file path, and the text range as arguments, to retrieve the official explanation and fix instructions.
5. Apply the appropriate fix based on the instructions, or ask the user if a choice needs to be made.
6. Also ensure any standard Java compilation or build errors are addressed.
